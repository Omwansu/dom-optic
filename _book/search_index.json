Chromophoric fraction of the DOM pool (CDOM) is a major driver of underwater light characteristics (Kirk1994) which modulate many bio-optical processes such as primary production (Thrane2014, Seekell2015) and also constitute a natural screen protecting aquatic organisms against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiations (Boily2012). Because of its colored nature, CDOM is known to strongly absorbs UV light. Blough and Vecchio (2002) provide a good definition of what is CDOM. Over the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in the properties and distribution of the major light-absorbing constituent of the (DOM) pool in natural waters (the 0.2 \\(μ\\)m fraction). This material—referred in the past by various names such as Gelbstoff, yellow substance, gilvin, and humic substances) has more recently been provided the name chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Measured in quartz cuvette (1, 5, 10+ cm) As wavelengths increase, light absorbed by CDOM decrease exponentially 3.1. library(cdom) data(spectra) spectra &lt;- spectra %&gt;% filter(wavelength &lt;= 500) p &lt;- ggplot(spectra, aes(x = wavelength, y = spc1)) + geom_line() + xlab(&quot;Wavelength (nm.)&quot;) + ylab(bquote(Absorption~(nm^{-1}))) p Figure 3.1: Example of an absorption spectrum of CDOM. 3.2 Writing and notation In reference to this fraction of the DOM pool, people have been using interchangeably different terminology. For example, a_g(\\(\\lambda\\)), a(\\(\\lambda\\)), CDOM(\\(\\lambda\\)), aCDOM(\\(\\lambda\\)) and \\(a_{CDOM}(\\lambda)\\) are all referring to the absorption coefficient measured at wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) (nm). To unify the terminology, we propose that absorption of CDOM should be written as \\(\\mathbf{a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda)}\\) using the followings rules: a in italic to reference to absorption (vs absorbance). CDOM subscripted and in capital letters. \\(\\lambda\\) sign to refer to the wavelength where the measurement is done. For example, \\(a_{\\text{CDOM}}(350)\\) refers to absorption coefficient measured at 350 nm. 3.3 Absorption vs absorbance \\[\\begin{equation} a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda) = \\frac{A(\\lambda) \\times 2.303}{L} \\label{eq:absorption} \\end{equation}\\] 3.4 Mathematical formulation of absorption spectra As observed in figure 3.1, absorption decrease exponentially with increasing wavelengths. Jerlov (1968) and Bricaud, Morel, and Prieur (1981) first proposed to use a simple exponential formulation to model absorption (equation \\ref{eq:cdom1}). \\[\\begin{equation} a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda) = a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda0)e^{-S(\\lambda - \\lambda0)} \\label{eq:cdom1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda)\\) is the absorption coefficient (m\\(^{-1}\\)), \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength (nm), \\(\\lambda0\\) is a reference wavelength (nm) and \\(S\\) is the spectral slope (nm\\(^{-1}\\)) that describes the approximate exponential rate of decrease of absorption with increasing wavelength. Higher slopes indicate a more rapid decrease in absorption with increasing wavelength. The \\(S\\) parameter is frequently used as a proxy for tracing photochemical and microbial-induced changes of CDOM [Moran2000,Twardowski2004,Helms2013] or to determine its origin [Stedmon2001]. In 2001, equation \\ref{eq:cdom1} was modified by C A Stedmon and Markager (2001) which introduced \\(k\\), a background constant (m\\(^{-1}\\)) accounting for scatter in the cuvette and drift of the instrument (equation \\ref{eq:cdom2}). \\[\\begin{equation} a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda) = a_{\\text{CDOM}}(\\lambda0)e^{-S(\\lambda - \\lambda0)} + \\mathbf{k} \\label{eq:cdom2} \\end{equation}\\] There are other mathematical formulations that can be used to model CDOM spectra. These are reviewed in Twardowski et al. (2004). 3.5 Modeling CDOM absorption spectra in R Because of it inverse exponential shape, absorption spectra are best modeled using non-linear fittings. In R this is done easy using the nls() function. As we can see from equation \\ref{eq:cdom2}, the most commonly equation used to model CDOM spectra contains three parameters: a0, s, k. mod &lt;- nls(spc1 ~ a0 * exp(-s * (wavelength - 250)) + k, # define the formula data = spectra, # where the data comes from start = list(a0 = 5, s = 0.02, k = 0)) # initial guesses. # show the summary information summary(mod) ## ## Formula: spc1 ~ a0 * exp(-s * (wavelength - 250)) + k ## ## Parameters: ## Estimate Std.

One question can potentially come to your mind. What is the effect of choosing a different reference wavelengths? What will append to \\(S\\) if we change the reference wavelength to let’s say 250? Fig. 3.3 shows that: Little effect (computational rounding) Figure 3.3: Effect of varying the reference wavelength on S. Plot the calculated curves on a graph 3.5.1.2 Choice of the spectral range Massicotte and Markager (2016) 3.6 Metrics \\(S_{300-600}\\) linked to DOM molecular weight (Colin A. Stedmon and Nelson 2015). 3.6.1 Slope ratio Equation \\ref{eq:sr} shows how the slope ratio (\\(S_R\\)) is calculated. \\[\\begin{equation} S_R = \\frac{S_{275-295}}{S_{350-400}} \\label{eq:sr} \\end{equation}\\] By calculating the ratio of the slope of the shorter wavelength region (275–295 nm) to that of the longer wavelength region (350–400 nm), a dimensionless parameter called “slope ratio” or \\(S_R\\) is defined. This approach avoids the use of spectral data near the detection limit of the instruments used, and focuses on absorbance values that shift dramatically during estuarine transit and photochemical alteration of CDOM (Helms et al. 2008). Figure 3.4 shows in red the 275-295 and 350-400 nm spectral range. Figure 3.4: Spectral range used to calculate the slope ratio. Fluorescence "]
