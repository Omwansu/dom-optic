Physical and chemical characteristics of the DOM transiting in aquatic ecosystems are important parameters that drive their functioning at different levels. For example, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the major fraction of the DOM pool and represents the main source of metabolic substrates for heterotrophic bacteria and influences the composition of aquatic microbial communities (Findlay2003). Additionally, the chromophoric fraction of the DOM pool (CDOM) is a major driver of underwater light characteristics (Kirk1994) which modulate many bio-optical processes such as primary production (Thrane2014, Seekell2015) and also constitute a natural screen protecting aquatic organisms against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiations (Boily2012). DOM is a complex mixture containing thousands of different chemical compounds (ref). Traditional chemical analysis used to characterize DOM are expensive. Optical methods have been developed. Why this project? Already few good books (Lakowicz 2006) Need for unified way to present stuff with correct citation. 1.1 References Fluorescence "]
