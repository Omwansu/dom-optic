                   characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) in
                   concentrated and unconcentrated water samples from a
                   wide variety of freshwater, coastal and marine
                   environments. Several types of fluorescent signals
                   were observed, including humic-like, tyrosine-like,
                   and tryptophan-like. Humic-like fluorescence
                   consisted of two peaks, one stimulated by UV
                   excitation (peak A) and one by visible excitation
                   (peak C). For all samples, the positions of both
                   excitation and emission maxima for peak C were
                   dependent upon wavelength of observation, with a
                   shift towards longer wavelength emission maximum at
                   longer excitation wavelength and longer wavelength
                   excitation maximum at longer emission wavelength. A
                   trend was observed in the position of
                   wavelength-independent maximum fluorescence
                   (Ex(max)/Em(max)) for peak C, with maximum at shorter
                   excitation and emission wavelengths for marine
                   samples than for freshwater samples. Mean positions
                   of these maxima were: rivers Ex(max)/Em(max) =
                   340/448 nm; coastal water Ex(max)/Em(max) = 342/442
                   nm; marine shallow transitional Ex(max)/Em(max) =
                   310/423 nm; marine shallow eutrophic Ex(max)/Em(max)
                   = 299/389 nm; and marine deep Ex(max)/Em(max) =
                   340/438 nm. Differences suggest that the humic
                   material in marine surface waters is chemically
                   different from humic material in the other
                   environments sampled. These results explain previous
                   conflicting reports regarding fluorescence properties
                   of DOM from natural waters and also provide a means
                   of distinguishing between water mass sources in the
                   ocean.},

                   poorly understood mixture of organic polymers that
                   plays an influential role in aquatic ecosystems. In
                   this study we have successfully characterised the
                   fluorescent fraction of DOM in the catchment of a
                   Danish estuary using fluorescence excitation-emission
                   spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC).
                   PARAFAC aids the characterisation of fluorescent DOM
                   by decomposing the fluorescence matrices into
                   different independent fluorescent components. The
                   results reveal that at least five different
                   fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant
                   amounts) in the catchment and that the relative
                   composition is dependent on the source (e.g.
                   agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic
                   production). Four different allochthonous fluorescent
                   groups and one autochthonous fluorescent group were
                   identified. The ability to trace the different
                   fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap
                   and fast technique represents a significant advance
                   within the fields of aquatic ecology and chemistry,
                   and will prove to be useful for catchment management.

                   method PARAFAC and its use in chemometrics. PARAFAC
                   is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays,
                   but some of the characteristics of the method are
                   quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There
                   is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure
                   spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral
                   data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components
                   successively as this will give a model with poorer
                   fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated.
                   Finally scaling and centering is not as
                   straightforward in the multi-way case as in the
                   two-way case. An important advantage of using
                   multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is
                   that the estimated models are very simple in a
                   mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and
                   easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are
                   explained in this tutorial and an implementation in
                   Matlab code is available, that contains most of the
                   features explained in the text. Three examples show
                   how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The
                   applications include subjects as: Analysis of
                   variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of
                   PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing,
                   PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC
                   for regression as in principal component regression.},

Although the chemical compounds responsible for these properties to date remain elusive, much can be gained from studying the distribution and dynamics of CDOM. The results from global surveys and experimental incubations indicate that CDOM measurements have the potential to be optical markers which trace the turnover of a DOM fraction that is not otherwise apparent from elemental analyses. A remaining key challenge is to evaluate how much of the carbon bound in DOM is associated with CDOM.},

                   Every chapter ends with a list of literature
                   references. Chapter 1 starts with the principles of
                   fluorescence describing physical characteristics, for
                   example emission, life-times, and quantum yields. The
                   second chapter offers insights into instrumentation
                   for fluorescence spectroscopy with an introduction to
                   devices such as spectrofluorimeters, lightsources,
                   filters, and detectors. Further on different applica-
                   tions of fluorescence spectroscopy are described
                   explicitly. The measurement methods and the
                   information one can gain from these are explained
                   equally well. The description covers experiments such
                   as life-time measurements, fluo- rescence-quenching,
                   and energy-transfer experiments, fluo- rescence
                   correlation spectroscopy, and life-time imaging
                   microscopy. For all these topics one can find basic
                   information and useful practical hints. Hence this
                   book covers all topics related to fluorescence
                   spectroscopy, starting with basic information and
                   moving toward actual topics of research and
                   application. Valuable information is also given in
                   chapters dedicated to fluorophores. In these chapters
                   common natural fluorophores, and novel fluoro- phores
                   such as lanthanides, quantum dots, and metal–ligand
                   complexes are presented and their different
                   properties are discussed. The book contains three
                   appendices providing standard data and spectra in a
                   clearly arranged overview. At the very end, answers
                   to questions asked throughout the book are given and

                   measurements are useful in fields such as food
                   science, analytical chemistry, biochemistry and
                   environmental science. EEMs contain information which
                   can be modeled using the parallel factor analysis
                   (PARAFAC) model but the data analysis is often
                   complicated due to both Rayleigh and Raman
                   scattering. There are several established ways to
                   deal with scattering effects. However, all of these
                   methods have associated problems. This paper develops
                   a new method for handling scattering using
                   interpolation in the areas affected by first- and
                   second-order Rayleigh and Raman scatter in such a way
                   that the interfering signal is, at best, removed. The
                   suggested method is fast and requires no additional
                   input other than specifying the scattering region.
                   The results of the proposed method were compared with
                   those obtained from common alternative approaches
                   used for preprocessing fluorescence data before
                   analysis with PARAFAC and were shown to be equally
                   good for various types of EEM data. The main
                   advantage of the interpolation method is in its lack
                   of additional metaparameters, its algorithmic speed
                   and subsequent speed-up of PARAFAC modeling. It also
                   allows for using EEM data in software not able to
                   handle missing data. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley

  abstract =      {The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is
                   suppressed by a phenomenon of self-quenching known as
                   the inner filter effect (IFE). Despite widespread use
                   of fluorescence to characterize DOM in surface
                   waters, the advantages and constraints of IFE
                   correction are poorly defined. We assessed the
                   effectiveness of a commonly used absorbance-based
                   approach (ABA), and a recently proposed controlled
                   dilution approach (CDA) to correct for IFE. Linearity
                   between corrected fluorescence and total absorbance
                   (ATotal; the sum of absorbance at excitation and
                   emission wavelengths) across the full
                   excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in dilution series
                   of four samples indicated both ABA and CDA were
                   effective to an absorbance of at least 1.5 in a 1 cm
                   cell, regardless of wavelength positioning. In
                   regions of the EEMs where signal to background noise
                   (S/N) was low, CDA correction resulted in more
                   variability than ABA correction. From the ABA
                   algorithm, the onset of significant IFE
                   ({\textgreater}5{\%}) occurs when absorbance exceeds
                   0.042. In these cases, IFE correction is required,
                   which was the case for the vast majority (97{\%}) of
                   lakes in a nationwide survey (n= 554). For highly
                   absorbing samples, undesirably large dilution factors
                   would be necessary to reduce absorbance below 0.042.
                   For rare EEMs with ATotal {\textgreater} 1.5 (3.0{\%}
                   of the lakes in the Swedish survey), a 2-fold
                   dilution is recommended followed by ABA or CDA
                   correction. This study shows that for the vast
                   majority of natural DOM samples the most commonly
                   applied ABA algorithm provides adequate correction
                   without prior dilution. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the

  abstract =      {The use of fluorescence spectrometry has been
                   suggested as a simple method to determine the extent
                   of natural organic matter humification by quantifying
                   the red-shifting of fluorescence emission that occurs
                   with increasing humification. Humification indices
                   are calculated by dividing fluorescence intensity at
                   longer wavelengths by intensity at shorter
                   wavelengths. These indices calculated without any
                   specific efforts to standardize dissolved organic
                   matter (DOM) concentration will result in index
                   values that vary with DOM concentration due to
                   fluorescence inner-filtering effects. This study
                   critically evaluated the effect of DOM concentration
                   on humification index determination using organic
                   matter isolated from field corn extract, soil: water
                   extract, and soil fulvic acid. The results show that
                   humification index values are sensitive to DOM
                   concentration of the solution and are linear with
                   respect to transmittance of the solution at the 254
                   nm used as the excitation wavelength. An approximate
                   correction for DOM is to exploit the linear nature of
                   the regression fit and to determine index values at
                   the extrapolated 100{\%} transmittance value. An
                   exact correction using explicit correction factors
                   for both primary and secondary inner-filtration
                   effects was shown to give humification index values
                   that are concentration invariant when absorbance of
                   the solution at 254 nm was less than approximately
                   0.3 unit. Defining the humification index as the
                   fluorescence intensity in the 300--{\textgreater}345
                   nm region divided by the sum of intensity in the
                   300--{\textgreater}345 nm and 435--{\textgreater}480
                   nm regions was statistically advantageous. This study
                   suggests that for quantitative results which can be
                   used to compare humification of natural organic
                   matter across different studies, correction of the
                   fluorescence emission spectra for inner-filtration
                   effects is needed.},
